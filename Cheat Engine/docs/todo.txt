globaldisassembleoverride is fucked


structure dissect: 
  delete all structures sometimes AV's (no idea how to reproduce)


memview paste: paste for specific displaytype
memview->rightclick while debugging: Change eip to position, run till position in the context menu as well


trainergen: get rid of tcheat and just use labels

dbvm_speedhack

graphical tutorial: continue with it

linux: make a 32-bit linux build with .so injection support

ceshare: continue with it
pseudocode: continue with it
mac version: work on it

define from debug data: Use a ownerdata list instead (or better, a whole new interface where you can see beforehand the layout)

structure compare: Closed a previous structure compare followed by reopening a new one and loading a file, messes up the popupmode and other stuff
pointerscan: generating pointermap should also check terminated
pointerscan: when suspending a scan, CE closed itself(crash)

test and fix the d3dhook stuff and trainer generator.  (perhaps dx12 support as well)

add  access rights for the windows app user to pipes

formdesigner: copy from outside a panel and paste into the panel will paste in the old location
a timer causing a lua_error will eventually show c stack overflow


dbvm: add maps and use them for cloaked regions
mono plugin: When enumerating classes instead of getting a class get the typedefs only and get the info from the typedef info until an actual class is requested/expanded
